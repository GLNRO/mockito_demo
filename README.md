mockito_demo
============

Simple example to demonstrate the utility of unit tests and mocking.

This simple example illustrates how to test-drive a class that depends on an unreliable external service using Mockito.

The following principles are illustrated:

1. You can test-drive (almost) any Java class.
2. Having a dependency on an unreliable, untested, external class does not prevent you from test-driving your code.
3. Dependency injection makes your code easier to test.
4. You will likely write a lot more unit-test code than business code. This is normal; so get used to it.
